DynDNS updater

Background
It wasn't too long after we upgraded the internet connection at home 
from dial-up to DSL, that I wanted to have remote access to some of 
the computers on the LAN at home. Two things are needed to enable this.
First port forwarding must be set up on the home router and second, 
one must know the ip address of the WAN side of the home router. 

Neither of these is difficult but the second, knowing the ip address
of the WAN side of the router is pretty inconvenient. With DSL, it 
seems to change everytime you reboot the DSL modem.

It turns out that there are many web services that address this issue. 
I chose DynDNS because, at the time, there was a free option and prehaps, 
more importantly, they had documentation exlaining the protocol.  Many home
routers have a feature that makes working with DynDNS really easy.
The 2Wire 2701HG-B combination modem / Wi-Fi residential gateway that we
purchased from our DSL service provider did not. So, began my quest to 
write my own updater. The scripts and programs in the sub-directories
here are the results of that effort. The TCL implementation was my first.
It served mainly as a proof of concept and is thus, pretty bare bones.
I started work on a more thorough implementation in C++ next and finally,
when I wanted to run the updater on an embedded Linux development board,
I re-wrote the whole thing in C.
