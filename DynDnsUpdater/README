DynDNS updater

Background:
=============================
It wasn't too long after we upgraded the internet connection at home 
from dial-up to DSL that I wanted to have remote access to some of 
the computers on the LAN at home. Two things are needed to enable this.
First, port forwarding must be set up on the home router and second, 
one must know the ip address of the WAN side of the home router. 

Neither of these is difficult but the second, knowing the ip address
of the WAN side of the router, is pretty inconvenient. With DSL, it 
seems to change everytime you reboot the DSL modem.

It turns out that there are many web services that address this issue. 
I chose DynDNS because at the time there was a free option and prehaps 
more importantly, they had documentation exlaining the protocol.  Many home
routers have a feature that makes working with DynDNS really easy.
The 2Wire 2701HG-B residential gateway that we purchased from our DSL service
provider did not. So began my quest to write my own dynamic dns updater. 
The scripts and programs in the sub-directories are the results of that effort.
I did the TCL implementation first as a proof of concept. It is pretty bare
bones but works perfectly. We dogfooded this for about a year.  During that 
time, I started work on a more thorough implementation in C++ but I re-wrote
the whole thing in C when I realized that the embedded system where I wanted
to run the updater client was too resource limited to allow the luxury of C++.

Update - as of mid January 2015, the C implementation is more-or-less complete.
Liberated from the curl library, this version depends only upon the GNU C library.
We've been dog-fooding it here at home since January 2015.
