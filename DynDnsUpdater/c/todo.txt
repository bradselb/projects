- revisit State.c with an eye toward following Config.c approach
- Complete the Config object
   loadConfig(), readConfig(0, writeConfig() all have trivial implementations 
- fix / improve security of Config file? 
- fix / improve current IP addr discovery
- improve ip address extraction. 
- standardize on new & delete instead of create & destroy.
- be const correct. 
- create a separate GUI tool to create and manip the Config file
- move config and state files to proper locations
- accept command line args
- make it a proper daemon
- write to syslog
- keep a history of the state...or, derive it from log file? 

ideas for new features: 
- use sqlite data base to keep track of update history.
