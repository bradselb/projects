- accept command line args
  * config file path
  * version
  * log file 
  * pid file
  * override config file params

- Complete the Config object
   loadConfig() - done.
   readConfig() - done
   writeConfig() 

- unit tests
   Config - done.
   State
   extractIpAddress()
   getURL()
   timeHelpers

- read config file from disk instead of always using the default config.
  (this is working now but, could definitely be improved).

- fix / improve current IP addr discovery (not sure what I had in mind here).
- improve ip address extraction. 
- standardize on new & delete instead of create & destroy.
- be const correct. 
- create a separate GUI tool to create and manip the Config file
- move config and state files to proper locations

- make it a proper daemon
- write to syslog
- keep a history of the state...or, derive it from log file? 

ideas for new features: 
- use sqlite database to keep track of update history.
- consider removing dependency upon libcurl.
  --> re-write getURL or add a more general http client object to lib.
