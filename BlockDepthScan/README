Block Depth Scan

Yesterday, on the way to a meeting, I had an idea for a utility that does some simple source code analysis.
I suppose that there exists a tool that accomplishes what I want to do but, I thought this an easy little thing to do and, I love to write code so, I'm going to take whack at rolling my own. But enough blathering on...here's the thing...


Big Goal:
   Develop a source code static analysis tool that produces descriptive and 
   summary statistcs. Measures of code anti-quality and bug location predition
   models could be developed from the results produced by this tool. 



strategy / tactics?:
Develop a static analysis tool that:
   1. scans multiple source files

   2. proceeds character by charater through each file

   3. for each character, keep track of:
       a) the current position (line and column)

   4. for each line, keep track of:
       a) indentation (level and pattern?)
       b) line length

   5. for each block, keep track of:
       a) start of block (position)
       a) end of block (position)
       a) block nesting depth
       b) block span

   6. for each file, produce descriptive and summary statistics
       a) block nesting depth frquency table
       b) block span frequency table
       c) line length frequency table
       d) indentation pattern freq table ?
